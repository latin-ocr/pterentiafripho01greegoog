THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 49

Do. 1 have been putting up sor some months against
my will with your promising and not performing and your
whimpering; but now Ι 've got the opposite ol all this. l
have found a man who pays and does n’t cry about it
Make way sor your betters.

AN. But, by heaven, is I remember rightly, there was a
day set on which you were to pay him?

PH. There was.

Do· Idon't deny it, dol?

AN. Has itcome yet?

Do. No, but to-day has come in abead os it.

AN. Are n't you ashamed to be such a fraud?

Do. Notabit isit is sormy gain.

Ga. Oh, you dunghill!

ΡΗ. Look here, Dorio, is this the right way to behave?

Do, It's my way; ir you like me, take me as you find
me.

ΑΝ. And you cheat him like this?

D0. On the contrary, Antipho, it 's hc who is cheating
me: sor he knew all along that l was the sort ol man l am;
but 1 supposed that he was different. He 's taken me in,
but to him l am exactly what I was before. But never
mind; this is what l'll do. A soldier man has promised
to pay me the money tomorrow morning; now, Phaedria,
is yon bring it to me belore he does, I'll follow my regular
rule, that he is the better man who is first to come down
with the cash. Good-bye. (Exit, R.)
