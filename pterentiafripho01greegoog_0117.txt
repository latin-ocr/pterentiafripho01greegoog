ΕΗ. (aride.) How or where did he ever corne to find this
out? DE. (aride.) Idon't know; but I'm sure I didn't
tell anybody.

PH. (aride.) I’ve put a spoke in his wheel. ·

DE. See here, is this rascal going to rob us of all this

death first! (aride to CH.) Make ready to be bold aud have
your wits about you. You see your little peccadillo has got

· · easiest way to get it forgiven, chremes( rs for us to tell her

ourselves what she' is sure to hear from others. And thery
we shall be able to revenge ourselves at our ease upon this

on abroad after your own sweet will without any regard for
yonder noble lady, buton the contrary, insulting· her in this
strange fashion, would you come now with prayers to wash
away your sin? Why, I’ll set her so afire against you with
this story that you shan’t put her out though you actually
dissolve away in tears.

DE. Was ever a man so impudenti Why does n't the
'- government transport the knave to some desert island?

CH. I'm reduced to such a state that 1 don't know what

ΡΗ. To law? to lter, if you don’t mind. ΕΗ. Follow him
up; hold on to him while Ι call the slaves out.
