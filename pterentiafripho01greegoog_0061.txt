THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. Very likely, as you say. Well, when 1 came ior· ·

ward l should have stated how she was related to me. Now,
you do the same. Come, how is she related? Gn. Bravo,
master, well done Ι and you, sir, look out lor yoursels.

ΡΗ. My duty was to explain it to the court, and I did
so with perfect clearness. Is it was n't' true, why did n't

your son disprove it on the spot? DE. You talk to me -
about my son? Why,I can't find words to describe his .,

stupidity. ΡΗ. Well, then, you who are sowise, go to the ’

magistrates and make them try the same case all over again
lor you. For you talk as though you were sole lord para-
mount in these parts and the only man alive entitled toa
second trial ol the same case. ’

DE. Though I have been unjustly treated, still, rather
than go to law or have to listen to you-here, just as ii
she really were related, take these five ducats, the dowry
that the law directs, and carry her away.

ΡΗ. 1131 hal hal you sweety! DE. What's the matter?
there 's nothing wrong in my demand, is there? am I not
to get the benefit ol what is the law of the land?

ΡΗ. Does the law direct you,1'd like to know, to pay '

her and send her off like a courtesan? Or was it to prevent

a freeborn lady from doing anything to disgrace herself .

through poverty that the law directs to give herto her
nearest kinsman to live with him? and that 's just what
you 're preventing.

DE. Yes, to her nearest kinsman. But how do we come
in, or on what grounds? ΡΗ. Oh, dear! ‘don't opena case
that 's closed,' as the saying goes. DE. Don’t open it? on
the contrary, 1³11 never rest until 1 ’ve seen it through.

ΡΗ. Silly olyou. DE. You just let me alone.

ΡΗ. ln short, Demipho,l’ve ndthing to do with you. It
was your son that lost the suit, not you 3 for your time sor
marrying was gone long ago.

DE· You can take him as saying all that 1 say now;
