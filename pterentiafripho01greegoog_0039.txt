THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

To say nothing ol your having got a well-born lady without

any expense, and ol having the wile os your choice publicly
acknowledged, and without any scandali Here you are per·
lectly happy except lor one thing, -a temper to bear it all
with equanimity. Is you had to deal with a slavetrader
like that one ol mine, then you 'd find out! But that 's the
way almost all os us are made ; we ’re dissatisfied with our
own lot.

AN. On the contrary, Phaedria, it seems to me that you
are the lucky man. You ’re still perlectly lree to make up
your mind to your liking—to keep your sweetheart or
to give her up. But I, unluckily, have got into such a fix
that I can neither keep mine nor let heru go either. But
what 's here? Is n't this Geta 1 see running up this way?
it 's the very man. Oh, dear rne, I'm dreadlully lrightened
about the news he may be bringing! (They retirc up.)

SCENE 11

(Enter GETA, hastily srom tlte port.)

Gn. You 're done lor, Geta, unless you lind some way
· out and mighty quick! Such troubles threaten you allos
a sudden and you 're so unprepared. I don’t see how to
dodge thern or how to get mysell' out ol this fix. Our
reckless doings can’t possibly be concealed any longer.
AN. (asida.) Why in the world is the man come in such
alright?
GE· Besides, I’ ve only a minute to think os it; master 's
. close by.
AN. (aride.) What ’s this trouble?
Ga. Once he's heard ol it, how shall I head off his lury?
