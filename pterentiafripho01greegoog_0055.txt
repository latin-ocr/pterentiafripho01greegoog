THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 31

(ΞΗ How does it come about?

PH. It's because we never set traps ior the hawks and
kites that really hurt us ; it ’s only sor birds that don’t hurt
that traps are set. There ’s something to be made out os
them, but on others it 's only time thrown away. Other
people have their dangers, from one source or another,--
people something can be got out os; but everybody knows
that I’ve got nothing to lose. But perhaps you 'll say·
that they ’ll convict me and take me home to hold me
there. Oh, no; they don't want to keep a ravenous sellow
like me; they don’t want to do good lor evil, and that 's
where they 're wisc, I think.

GE. Well, he can’t ever thank you as much as you
deserve.

ΡΗ. Not quite so. Nobody ever can thank his patron as
muchashedeserves. Thinkoiitl You come scot free to his
dinner‚ all perlumed and shiniug lrorn the bath, witha heart
sree from care, when he 's drowned with worry and eaten up
with expenses. While everything’s done to your liking,
he ’s snarling. You can laugh, drink your wine before

Ἴ him, take the higher seat ; and then a puzzling banquet 's
spread.

Ge. What ’s that?

ΡΗ. That ’s when you ’re puzzled what to help yourself
to first. Nou, when you corneto reckon up how nice all
this is and how much it coste, are n’t you obliged to think

. your host a god incarnate right before your eyes?

GE. Here ’s the old man ; mind what you 're about; the
first onset is always the fiercest ls you stand that, you
may afterwards make play as you like.
