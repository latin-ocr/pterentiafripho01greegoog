THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

AN. I'm al! abroad! GE. But that's ,just where you
must n't be now, Antipho; ior your fatherwill think you
guilty if he sees you srightened.

PH. That ’s true. ΑΝ. Ι can’t change my nature.

GE. Suppose you had to do something stil! harder‚ what
then? AN. As 1 ean’t do this, 1 could do that stil! less.

GE. It’s no use, Phaedria; it ’s all over. Why waste our

¹9

time here ior nothing? I'm off. PH. And 1 too (going). ⁵

AN. For mercy's sake! Suppose 1 make believe? will
this do? (strikes an attitude.) GE. Silly!

AN. But just look at my sace· There! is that satisfac·
tory? GE. No. ΑΝ. How about this?

Gr„ Pretty sair. Au. And this?

GE. That will do. Keep that, and look out that you
answer him word sor word, tit ior tat, so that he shan’t
rout you with harsh language while he ’s iu a passion.

AN. Iunderstand. GE. Say you were forced into it, ι

against your will. PH. By the law—by the court.

GE. Do you catch on? But who 's that old man 1 see
down the street? it 's the governor!

AN. Ican't sace him. GE. Here! what are you doing?
where are you going, Antipho? Wait, I say.

ΑΝ. Iknow myseli and my own fault Ileave Pha-
nium and my own lise in your hands. (Runr off, R.)

PH. What 's going to be done now, Geta?

GE. You ’11 get a wigging pretty soon, and I shall
be strong up and whipped‚ if I'm not mistaken.⁴ But
we ought to do ourselves, Phaedria, just what we were
advising Antipho.

PH. None o! your ‘oughts' just give me your orders
what I'm to do.

Gn. Do you remember what you said long ago when we
started in with this affair, about protecting ourselves from
trouble—that the other side's case was just, easy, sure to
win, the best in the world ?
