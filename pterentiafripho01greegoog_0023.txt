THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

In that you saw another play os late
Unwitting Oedipus's crimes and sate,

Those were the deeds os heroes, tragic themes
For which sublimity weil fitted seems,

The practised art of actorS, fine array

And setting, with the fame os rare display. ‘
Our aim is lower. Mortal men are we,

And so content the mimickers to be

Oi human joys and griess; the gods may care
For their own matters, men are our affair.

Yet pray these iowly things do not disown,
They touch us nearer being better known, ¹
The woes of Hecuba we 've long outgrown. -
Epidicazomenos was the Grecian name,

In Latin, though, it Phormio became;

Because the ‘star,' a parasite, is one

Named Phormio, by whom the most is done.
Do you, adopting Terence' famous line,

‘I am a man; ali that is man’s is mines
Regard our novel effort with good will,

That generous arts may thrive among us still.
