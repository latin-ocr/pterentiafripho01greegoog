THE PHORMIO of TERENCE.

SCENE 11

(Enter GETA, R.)

GE. (aride.) A shrewder sellow than Phormio I never
saw in my born days. I went to tell him that money was
wanted and how it was to be got. Ihad hardly told him
hali the story when he understood it alh—began to laugh,

Ι congratulated me, asked where the old man was. Then he

thanked heaven that now he had a chance to show that he
was as much oi a friend to Phaedria as to Antipho. Ι told
the iellow to wait on ’Change, and said that I would bring
the old man there. Holloai here he is. Who's that on
the other side? Oh my! Phaedria’s father 's come home.
Lubber that 1 am, what was I afraid os Ρ was it because I 've
got two to trick instead os one? It's handier, I think, to
have two strings to your bow. I’ll try to get the money
from the man I meant originally. ΙΙ he gives it, all right3
is nothing can be done with him, then I'll attack this
newcomer.

SCENE 111

(Enter ANTIPHO, unobserved, R.)

ΑΝ. (aride.) I'm expecting Geta back every minute.
Why, there 's my uncle standing with my father. Dear me!
how Ι do sear what father may be driven to by his coming!

GE· I'll go up. Why! our good friend Chremes! how
. do you do? CH. How do you do, Geta?

Gn. I'm delighted to see you back saie. CH. Dare say.

Gn How goes it? Do you find many surprises here, as
usual when a man comes home? CH. A good many.

GE· To be sure. Have you heard what 's happened to
Antipho? CH. The whole story.
