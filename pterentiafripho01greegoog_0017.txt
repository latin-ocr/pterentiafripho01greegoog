THE ARGUMENT

Tnnnssnrno ur J. Β. Gnnsuouou

One Chremes had a brother Demipho,

Who wishing sor some cause abroad to go,

Had left his son young Antipho at home

At Athens, while it pleased him thus to roam.

' This Chremes had a wife and daughter too

In Lemnos domiciled, that no one knew ;
Another one at Athens, and an heir

That desperately loved a harper sair.

From Lemnos came the mother with the maid
To Athens, and there died. The daughter paid
The last sad rites (now Chremes was away).
And so it carne about that on that day

Young Antipho the orphan chssd espied,

Feli deep in love and took her for his bride

('T was through a parasite 't was brought about).
The brothers coming horne with rage broke out,
Gave thirty minae to the parasite

To take her off and marry her outright.

With this theybuy the girl that Phaedria prized,
The other keeps his bride now recognized.
