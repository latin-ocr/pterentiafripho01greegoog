these things happen to everybody, they can huppen to

but everything that surprises you by ending well, you can
set down as so much clear gain.

GE„ (arride.) Ha, Phaedria! It's past belief how much

more ot' a sage Ι am than my master. 1 have reflected on
. all the troubles that master's return will bring upon me,—

ΡΗ. Why, what ’s the matter?

DE. What a question, Phaedria! This is a fine marriage

ΡΗ. Holloal are you angry with him ior that?

just aching to get a sight os him, so that he may find out

into a perfect savagel ΡΗ. But he has n’t done anything
to make you angry, uncle. DE. Now just look at that!

sketch oi their proceedings without knowing it.
