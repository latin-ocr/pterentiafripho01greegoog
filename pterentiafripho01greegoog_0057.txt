GE. He says not. PH. And that he does n't know who
her father was? GE. He says not.

DE. Ι lancy this is the very man I was talking about.
Follow me.

PH. Because the poor thing is lest in poverty, her father
is disowned and she herscll is abandoned. Only see what
avarice does! GE. Yon 'll hear what you won't like ii you
insinuate anything wrong about my master.

initiative by accusing me l

sellow for not knowing her lather3 os course he was a man
pretty well along, poor, working sor his living, generally
keeping in the country, where my father let him have a
farm to cultivate. The old iellow used osten to tell me how
this kinsman ol his neglected him. But what a fine man
he was! the bestI ever saw in all my life.

GE. I hope you 'll ever see yourself such as you de·

2 scribe him.

ΡΗ. You be hangedl Νο; it I had n’t esteemed him as
l did, l should never have got into a quarrel with your
people, all on account os this girl that your master's slight-
ing now in this ungentlemanlike way.
