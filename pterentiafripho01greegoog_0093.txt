THE PHORMIO 01² TERENCE.

ΕΗ. (arride.) Why, who ’s this old woman that 's come
out 01 my brother's house so excited?

So. lt was our poverty that drove me to it, though 1
knew such a marriage was a shaky thing, to provide that
at least she might be sure 01 a living in the meantime.
¹ ΕΗ. (aside.) Upon my word, unless my mind ’s going
or my eyesight 's bad, that ’s my own daughter's nurse that
Isee there.

So. And we can’t track out—

ΕΗ. (asida) What shall Ι do?

So. Her father—

ΕΗ. (aside.) Shall I go and speak to her, or stay where
1 am until 1 know better what she is saying? .

So. 11 only I could find him, there ’s nothing I should be
afraid 01. ·

ΕΗ. It ’s the very woman. I'll speak to her.

So. Who 's this talking here? CH. Sophronal

So. Calling me by name, too. CH. Look at me. ·

ι So. Oh, good graciousl can this be Stilpo?

CH. No! So. What? no? ·

ΕΗ. Come over here a little, away 110111 that door,
Sophrona, please, and don’t call me by that name any
more. So. Why not? 101 mercy¹s sake, are n't you the
man you always said you were? CH. Hush!

So, What is there in this door that you 're afraid 011

ΕΗ. I've got a savage wife caged up in there. As 101
tlrat name, it was awrong one which l took in those days, so
that you should n't let the truth leak out without meaning
to, and my wife lind it out some way or other,

So. Law me, that 's just why we poor women have never
been able to find you. ΕΗ. But tell me, what have you to
do with the people whose house you just came out from?
