CH. When you have attended to that, go over to my
wile's to get her to call on the girl before she goes away.
Let her tell the girl, to prevent her from being angry, that
we are marrying her to Phormio, and that he is a better
match sor her, because she knows him better; and that we
have done our duty, too, and given her as large a dowry as
he asked lor.

De. What the plague does that matter to you?

do your duty il the world does n't approve of what you 've
done. 1 want this to take place os her own free will, so that
she shan’t be saying that we drove her out.

DE. Well, I can bring all that about mysels.
