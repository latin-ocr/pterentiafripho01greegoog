ACT IV
SCENE 1

(Enter Dslnrno and canantes, a)

DE. Well, Chremes, did you bring your daughter with
you, what you went to Lemnos for? CH. No.

Da. Why not? CH. Why, when her mother saw that 1
kept staying and staying on in Athens, and the girl was ·
grown up and could n’t be neglected any longer, she set
out, they told me, bag and baggage‚ to come and find me.

DE. Then why, I want to knoW, did you stay there so
long when you heard that? CH. 'Gad, I was kept there by
' illness. Du How so? what illness?

CH. What illness? old age is illness enough in itsels.
But the skipper who brought them told me that they
reached here sale and sound. DE. Have you heard what
has happened to my son in my absence, Chremes?

CH. That's just what makes me so undecided. in my

plans. Fo'r il I offer her in marriage to any outsider, l
must tell the whole story os how and by whom l cameto
be her father. As lor you‚l knew that you were as loyal
to me as I arn to mysels. But ii a stranger seeks alliance
with me, he will hold his tongue just so long as we are
close friends with one another; but il he breaks with me,
then he will know more than he ought to know. And I’m

afraid my wile may get an inkling ol all this. Is she does,
the only thing lest sor me to do is to give mysell a shake
and leave the house; lor l’m all I've got in the world.

DE. 1 know that is so; that 's what makes me so anxious,
and I shall never weary os making every effort to perform
my promise lor you.
