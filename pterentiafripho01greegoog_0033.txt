THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

laet, ii she had n't been the very esseuce of beauty‚ all this
would have eclipsed her beauty. The young lellow who
was in love with the harplady only said, ‘She 's very
pretty;' but my young master—

DA. I know without being told; he iell in love with her.

GE. Ratherl= See how it turns out. The very next
day he went straight to the old woman; begged that he
might have her. But she refused, and said he was n’t doing ·
the proper thing; ‘sor the girl was an Athenian, a good.
girl os good stock. ll he wanted to marry her, it could be
done in the regular legal way; but il he meant anything
else, no.’ My master did n't know what to do; on the one
hand he longed to marry the girl, on the other he was afraid'
ol his father, who was gone abroad.

DA. Would n't his father have given him leave when he
came home? GE. What, he! give leave to marry a girl - .
without a dowry and os unknown family? Never in the
world. -

DA· well, what happened in the end?

GE. What happened? There ’s a parasite of the name
ol Phormio -a eheeky lellow - blast him l

DA. Why, what ’s he been up to?

GE. He supplied the scheme which l am going to de-
scribe. ‘There ’s a law‚‘ says he, ‘that orphan girls must
marry their next os hin, and by the same law the kinsmen
are obliged to marry them. Now, l'll say that you 're her
lrimman, and I'll bring a suit against you. l’ll pretend
’ that I was a iriend os the girl’s father. We shall come into
court. Who her father was, and who her mother, and how
she is related to you, I’ll make all that up. lt will be
good and easy sor me, for you won’t disprove any os the
charges and so oi course Ι shall win. Your father will
come home; that means a lawsuit against me. But what
dol care lor that? The girl will be ours anyhow.

DA. A jolly piece oi cheelr!
