THE PHORMlO OF TERENCE.

Gn. (to De.) You told him, then? What an outrageous
thing, Chremes, to be taken in in this way.

CH. Just what I was telling him.

GE· But on thinking it all over carelully, by the powers
Ι believe 1 've found a way out of it

CH. What, Geta?

DE. What 's your way out?

GE. When Ι lest you Ι happened to meet Phormio.

CH. Who ’s Phormio?

DE. The man who was her-

CH. Isee.

GE. I thought l had better find out his real feelings, so
I buttonholed the fellow. ‘Phormio' says I, ‘why not try
to settle these matters that are between us with good leel·
ing, rather than with bad? My master is a gentleman, and
he is shy os law-suits. But, by the powers, all his friends
have just been advising him with one voice to turn the girl
out of doors! ’

AN. (aride.) Now what cau he be startlng ou, or how
will he end this blessed day?
GE. ‘But, you 'll say, won't the law punish him if he

turns her out? He 's looked into that already, and I tell
you, you 'll have to sweat sor it, is you begin on a man like
him. He 's that eloquentl But come, suppose he is beaten:
at the worst it ’s only money that 's at stake, and not his
lise) When Ι saw that the lellow was shaken by this talk,
‘Here we are by ourselves,' says 1; ‘come now, say what
you want in cash lor yoursell to release my master from this
lawsuit, she to make herself scarce, and you to give no
trouble’

AN. (aride.) Can he be in his sober senses?

GE, ‘The fact is, Ι am certain that if you name anything
that 's at all fair and reasonable, there won't be three words
between you. He 's such a kind-hearted man!

DE. Who gave you orders to say that?
