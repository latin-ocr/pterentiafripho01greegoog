THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

what then? GE„ But he won't marry her. ΑΝ. Oh, no!
But when they ask the money back, then os course he ’ll
prefer to go to jail sor my sake.

GE. There is n't any story in the world, Antipho, that
can't be spoiled in the telling. Now you 're leaving out all
the good side and telling only the bad. Now, then, hear
the other side. Suppose now he gets the'money: he will

. have to marry her,asyou say; Iadmit that;—but they 'll ’

give him a little time anyhow to get ready for the wedding,
to send out the invitations, and to offer sacrifice. Mean·

κ while Phaedria’s friends will give him the money which they

have promised, and Phormio will pay back the dowry out os
that AN. On what ground? what can he say?

GE. What a question! ‘Since my engagement I 've had
so many bad omens. A strange black dog trotted straight
into my l'ront hall ; a snake fell down from the roos through
the rain-hole; a hen has crowed; the clairvoyant lorbade
it, the soothsayer won’t let me. Besides, to take up any-
thing new before the winter sets in,' - that ’s the strongest
reason in the world. That ’s the way it will be.

AN. Ionly hope it may. GE. May? It shall. Look to
me sor that. There ’s your father coming out. Go tell
Phaedria that we’ve got the money. (Exit ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ, R.)

SCENE V

(Enter Dnmmo and cernamus, from Cannues's.)

DE. Do be quiet, Isay. I'll take care he does n't play
me any trick. I’ll never let the money go lrom me helter-
skelter without having witnesses. I’ll have it understood
to whom I am giving it and why I give it.

GE. (asida.) How cautious he is, where he hasn't any
call to be.
