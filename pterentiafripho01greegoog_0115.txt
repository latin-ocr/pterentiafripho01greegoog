DE. What ’s to be done then?

PH. Il you will give me the lady as you erJ-mised, l will
marry her; but il you really want her to stay with you,
Demipho, why the dowry must stay with me. lt is n’t fair
that I should be the loser through the means ol you two;
lor it was out ol regard ior you that I broke off with the
other lady who was to bring me just as large a dowry. .

DE. You be hanged with your high-toned talk, you vagas
hond! do you suppose that we don’t know you and your

, doings? ΡΗ. You 're making me angry. DE. So you 'd
¹ marry her, would you, is we gave her to you?

ΡΗ. Try iton. DE. Yes, so that my son might live with
her in your house; that was your scheme.

PH. What are you talking about, pray? DE. Come, hand
ovg my money. ΡΗ. Not much; you hand over my wile.

DE. Walk straight into'court then. ΡΗ. Look here, is
you are going to keep on being troublesome -

DE. What are you going to do about it? ΡΗ. I? perhaps
you two think that Ι ’m the protector os undowried women
only; but 1 'm in the habit os protecting dowried ones too.

CH. What’s that to us? ΡΗ. Oh, nothing. ButIknewa ’
woman round here whose husband married —-

ΕΗ. Ha! DE. What’s the matter? ΡΗ. Another wise
. at Lemnos— ΕΗ. l'm done sor! ΡΗ. By whom he had
a daughter ; is bringing her up, too, on the sly. ΕΗ. I ’m as
good as buried. ΡΗ. l’m just going to tell her all about it.

ΕΗ. For heaven’s sake, don'tl ΡΗ. Oh, you were the
man, were you? DE. What game he 's making of us!

CH. We let you off scot free. ΡΗ. Oh, bosh! CH. Well,
what would you have? We let you off with the money that
you ’ve got. ΡΗ. Oh, yes! Why the deuce are you making '
game ol me with your silly, childish shilly-shallying? ‘I
won't, lwill, and 1 will, I won’t,’—one aster the other;
‘take it- give it back’ —say a thing and unsay it; make
a bargain one minute and break it off the next.
