THE PHORMlO OF TERENCE.

Where are the ladies? SO. Oh, dear me! CH. Heyi
what 's the matter? are n't they alive?

So. Your daughter is3 but her mother, poor thing, died
of grief.

ΕΗ. Too bad!

So. And so l, being only a lone lorn old woman, whom
nobody knew, did my best and got the girl married to the
young gentleman who lives in here

ΕΗ. To Antipho?

So. Certainly ; the very man.

ΕΗ. What! has he got two wives?

SO. For pity's sake, n0; she ’s the only one he has. ·

ΕΗ. What about the other who is called his relative? ¹

So. Why, it's she, os course.
ΕΗ. What ’s that you say?

71

So. lt was a put-up job, -the only way by which her

lover might get her without a dowry.

ΕΗ. Heaven help us! how osten things do turn out by .
haphazard which you 'd scarcely dare to wish t'orl Here ·

I’ve come home and iound my daughter married to the

very man 1 wanted and just as I wanted it! The very thing '

that we were both trying with all our might to bring about,
he has taken the greatest trouble to do all by himself with-

7 out any trouble of ours.

So, Well now, just see what ’s to be done next. Thi
young man's father has arrived, and they say that he is
bitterly opposed to it. “

ΕΗ. There 's no danger at all. But, by· heaven and
earth, don’t let anybody find out that she is my daughter.

So. ⁰·Nob0dy shall from me.

ΕΗ. Follow me; you shall hear the rest inside.
