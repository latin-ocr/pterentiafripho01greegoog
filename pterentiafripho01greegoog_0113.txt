THE PHORMIO of TERENCE. 89

CH. Is n¹t she a thorough lady though, as I told you?

DF. Through and through. We must now find Phormio
as soon as possible and get our thirty ducats away lrom
him before he makes ducks and drakes os them.

ΡΗ. (coming sorward.) I’ll just see whether Demipho
is at home, so as to - DE. Ah, we were just going to see

. you, Phormio. ΡΗ. On the same old errand, perhaps?

Da. Yes, to be sure. PH. isupposed so. But what
made you think rt necessary to come? DE. Oh pooh!

ΡΗ. Did you think I would n 't do what 1 had once under·
taken? See here, however poor I may be, there' s one thing
I’ ve always been particular about, and that rs to keep my
word. And so I came to tell you this, Demiph0, that Im
all ready. Give me my wile whenever you wish. Ihave
put off all my other business, and properly enough too,
when 1 saw how very bent you were upon it.

' DE. But Chremes here has persuaded me not to give ·
her to' you. ‘ Why, what will Mrs. Grundy say,’ says he, ‘is
you do that? Awhile ago, when you could have done it ⁴
decently, you did n’t release her. To turn her out now, 2
divorced, isan outrage! In lact, his arguments were all
pretty much the same that you urged against me yourseli a
while ago sace to sace.

ΡΗ. You’ re making game of me in a pretty high and X
mighty way. DE How’ s that? “

ΡΗ. How’s that? ?Wh,y because I shan't be able to

· marry that other girl nou. For how could 1 have the sace
to go back to the woman after slighting her?

CH. (asida to DE.) ‘Besides I see that Antipho does n't

want to let her leave him’ -say that.
DE. Besides 1 see that my son doesnt at all want to let

the woman leave him So corne over to the bank, please,
and have that money transferred to me again, Phormio.

ΡΗ. What! asterI have already paid it round among my
different creditors?
