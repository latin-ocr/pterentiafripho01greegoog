THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE· Ι1 it was n’t so, you would n't be taking his part,
Phaedria.

ΡΗ. Well, uncle, 11 it is a fact that Antipho has donea
wrong, regardless 01 his interests or reputation, I have
nothing to say against his suffering as he has deserved.
But ii somebody took advantage 01 his own cunning to
lay a snare ior our youthsul innocence and has caught us
in it, is it our fault or that 01 the judges? You know what
a habit they have 01 robbing the rich irom envy, and giving
to the poor from pity.

GP„ (aride.) Ii I did 01 know the case, I should believe
that he was telling the truth. ΒΕ. Is there ajudge alive
who can possibly know your rights when you don't answer
aword yourseli, like that son 01 mine?

Pu. He behaved like a young man oi good breeding. .

²5

When we got into court, he could n’t speak his piece; his ·

modesty'struck him quite dumb then and there.

Gn. (aride.) ¹Bravo, you! but shall 1 not address the
old man at once? (going sunuard.) Good day, master.
I’m glad you 've got home saie.

DE· Ha, ha! fine guardian, good day, main stay 01 my
house; it was in your charge that 1 leit my son when 1
went away.

GE. I've heard you blaming us all ior ever so long when
we did n't deserve it, and I least 01 anybody. Why, what

would you have had me do in the matter? the laws don’t ,

allow a man who 's a slave to plead, and he can't give
evidence either. t
DE. Iwaive all that, and 1 admit this, too, that the boy

was afraid and unsuspecting. 1 grant that you are a slave.
But no matter how near a relative she was, he need 01 have
married her; no, 00. You should have given her a dowry,
as the law directe, and let her look out ior another hus·

band. On what account, theu, did he prefer to bring home
a pauper?
