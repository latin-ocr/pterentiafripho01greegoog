SCENE 1

(Enter Divos n.)

DA. My particular friend and countryman, Geta, came to
see me yesterday. Ihad been owing him some small bal-
ance 01 cash on account a good while, and he asked meto
get it together. I've got it together, and l'm ‘bringing it
to him now. ‘ibe fact is, I'm told that his master’s son has
got married ; it ’s sor the girl, 1 suppose, that he 's seraping
this testimonial together. How unsair it is that poor lolks
should always be adding something to rich people's piles!
Now here 's Getar- the poor iellow’s been saving up out
01 his rations a pint at a time, and⁴ hardly that, cheating
his own belly, and now my lady ’ll spoil him 01 it all without
ever thinking what a lot 01 work it took to get it Then
besides they ’ll strike him sor another testimonial when she
has a baby; and then another too when the baby has a
birthday‚ and another when it gets initiated. The mother,
01 course, will walk 011 with it all, and the child will be only
an excuse sor the gift. But don’t l see Geta?
