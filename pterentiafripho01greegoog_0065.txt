THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. Yes sir. CRA. 1 should like to have you act ior the
. interests oi your house. Now this is the way it seems to

me; it 's all right and proper that what your son has done
in your absence should be put back entirely as it was, and
you will carry that' point That 's what 1 say.

DE. Nou, Hegio, it 's your turn to speak.

HE. 1 believe that he has spoken advisedly; but this is
the way os it; many men oi many mimis, many birds os
many kinds ; each man has his own point oi view. Now it
doesn't seem to me that what the law has done can be
undone; and it ’s discreditable to try it. DE. Well, Crito?
CRI. 1 vote we take time to think it over; it 's important

HE. We can't do anything more sor you, can we?

DE. You have done finely. (Extant advisers, P.) 1 'm
much more bewildered than before. (Enter GE. from DE.'s

’“ muse.) GE. They say he has n't come in. DE. Imustwait

ior my brother. I’ll follow the advice which he gives me
in the matter. I’ll go down to the port to find out when
he's to come home. (Exit L.) GE. And l'll go look
sor Antipho, so that he may know how things are. But,
holloa! 1 see him coming in the niek os time.

SCENE 1v

(Enter Annium, n.)

AN. well, Antipho, you and your panic have much to
answer ior. The idea oi your having made oti and lest your
very liie in other people's keeping! Did you suppose that
others would attend to your business better than you would
yourseli ? No, no ; however it was about the rest, you cer-
tainly ought to have taken care oi that girl oi yours at home,
to prevent her from getting into trouble from her trust in
you. All she has and all she hopes ior, poor thing, hinge
on you alone nov.
