ΡΗ. Not lor. you of course, but she ought to know. ln ·

Lemnos-

CH. Won't you hold your tongue? ,

CH. Oh dear me!

ΡΗ. He married another wile.

ΝΑ. God iorbid, my dear man!

ΡΗ. lt’s true. .

NA· Alasl I’m undonel

ΡΗ. And by her he ’s already had one daughter too,

Nn Was there ever anything more inlamousi When it
comes to their wives, they 're old enough, forsooth! Demi-
pho, 1 appeal to you, lor l am sick os talking to this creature.

DF„ For my part, Nausistrata, 1 don't say that he does n't
deseruero be blamed in this matter, but it isa lauit that
may be pardoned.

ΡΗ. Might as well talk to the dead.

DE. The fact is, it was not that he did n't care lor you or
that he disliked you. His affair with this woman was

Ι about fifteen years ago, once when he had drunlr too much,
'and' that was how this girl came to be born; he never went
near the woman afterwards; she is dead and out of the way;

that was the only stumbling·block lest. And so 1 beg of ,

you that you will bear this patiently, as you act in other
things.
