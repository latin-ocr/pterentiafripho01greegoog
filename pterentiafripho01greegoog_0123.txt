THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

NA· Patiently-why should I? 1 certainly do want to
have an end ol it all, I'm uo wretched3 but how could 1
expect that? can Ι count on his sinning less as he grows
older? He was an old man even then, if it's old age that
makes men virtuous. Do my own looks or my years make
me more attractive now than Iwas then, Demipho? Come,
what can you offer to make me expect or trust that this ,
won't happen again?

PH. All who desire to attend the funeral os Chremes,
now 's the time! That 's the way I'll give it to ’eml Now
come on, whoever wants to stir up Phormio! ljll ruin him

swanum vs..
. on esoangry; calm yourself‚ Nausistrata.

PH. Yes, yes, let him back into your good graces; he ’s
been punished enough to satissy me. And she 's got some-
'thing to din into his ears just as long as he lives,

NA. Ι deserved it, then, 1 suppose. Why should 1, at
this late day, Demipho, rehearse what a wile 1 've been to
him?

DE. Ilmow it all aswell as you do.

, Nn. Do you think I've deserved this treatment?

DE. Never in the world. But what 's done cannot be
. undone by reproaches. Do forgive him-megs pardon,
-he owns up, —he offers to atone. What more can you
want? W

PH. (asida) Really now, before she pardons him 1 must
look out lor mysels and Phaedria (aloud.) See here,
Nausistrata, just listen to me before you answer him off·

hand.
NA. What is it?

PH. Ι got thirty ducats out ol him bya trick, and gave
them to your son. He bought his mistress with them from
her owner.
