THE PROLOGUE

Bv J. Β. Gneawoucn

That this to all be prospered is our prayer;

Patrons os noble arts and judges fair,

We are to act a play, a Latin one,

By Tully witnessed and by Roscius done,

The work os Terence; with such names as these
To recommend us, we must surely please.

I called it Latin, Ι was partly wrong;

No doubt the verses to that tongue belong;
But incidents and thought are purely Greek,
The Latin part is but the words we speak.

For just as that we call an English play

Is what some F renchman elever in that way
Has made before3 so Romans thought no shame
To take from Greece and publish in their name.
What use, then, now to offer you a play

Not even native and long past its day,

A scenic outline when in Greek 't was made,
And now a laded shadow of that shade?
Because while ages keep their steady pace,

The aims and nature os the human race
Continue still the same; their sear and woe‚
TheIr joys and their desires, no changes show.
The Latin that we speak in Grecian dress
Mirrors the nature ol our age no less.

Only the outward acts and garb are old,

The rest is fresh as when ’t was first unrolled. —
